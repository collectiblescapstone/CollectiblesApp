RELEVANT SKILLS: Uses her phone and computer regularly. Comfortable with apps and websites. 
BEHAVIOURAL DETAILS: Collects cards as a hobby and is only aware of the grading system by proxy. Has never graded a card and does not care about the official grading system.
                     Tends to hoard cards and is not willing to let go of duplicates easily. Willing to spend money on a card just because she likes it.
FRUSTRATIONS: Has multiple small binders to store cards and finds it hard to remember which binder has which cards. Has trouble keeping track of duplicates.
GOALS: Wants to keep track of her collection of cards. Her favourite Pokemon is Nihilego, who is not featured on many cards. 
        Because of this, Sandra will collect multiples of the same card to fill out her binders. She wants to be able to indicate that 
        she has multiples of a card in her collection. She also wants to be able to indicate the condition of each cards, as some duplicates are in
        better condition than others. She wants to be able to differentiate the binders by what is on the cover and not their specific location in her room.
        Wants to reduce her collection size and thus wants to be able to indicate that she is selling any cards that she does not care for.
